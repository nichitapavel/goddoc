Fast scan of the <network> (subnet) [1]:

Scan network and get MAC info (use `sudo` before cmd):
  sudo nmap -sn <network>
  i.e.: sudo nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24
Scan and filter network based on a host's mac (search in your network a device with mac address):
  sudo nmap -sn <network> | grep -i -B 2 "<MAC>" | grep -vi "host is"
