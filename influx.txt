InfluxData commands, can be related to influxdb, telegraf, chronograf, kapacitor etc...

Make a full backup of Influxdb database [1]:
  influx backup backup_$(date '+%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M')
Find out disk size of a bucket in influxdb:
  - make a backup
  - in the backup search for a *.manifest file
  - this file has the buckets with the sizes, but they are distributed
  - do a grep search and a sum to find your size:
    grep bucketName *.manifest -A 3 | grep <bucket name> -A 3 | grep size | cut -c 14-22
    i.e.: grep bucketName *.manifest -A 3 | grep system-cpu -A 3 | grep size | cut -c 14-22
