### cmd: `fish --version` -> fish, version 3.1.2
- Copy  or symoblic link contents from this directory to `~/.config/fish/`
- **functions** _la_, _ll_ and _update-dist_ are available as **abbr** (abbreviations) and are
**optional** (either **abbr** or **functions**).
- _fish_aliases_ is the old way for having _la_, _ll_ and _update-dist_
