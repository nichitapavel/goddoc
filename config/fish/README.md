Fish config
==========

### cmd: `fish --version` -> fish, version 3.1.2
- Copy or symbolic link contents from this directory to `~/.config/fish/`
- **functions** _la_, _ll_ and _update-dist_ are available as **abbr** (abbreviations) and are
**optional** (either **abbr** or **functions**).
- If the same **function** is available as **abbr**, the last one has priority
- To update **abbr** commands erase the old one, close and open all fish sessions
- _fish_aliases_ is the old way for having _la_, _ll_ and _update-dist_
